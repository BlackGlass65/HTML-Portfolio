<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an artist based in Madison, Wisconsin, and I focus on dark and dystopian art that intertwines 
</br>traditional techniques with innovative technology. Holding a degree in Fine Art from the </br>University of Wisconsin-Madison, I have honed a unique style
 that explores the deeper, </br>often shadowy aspects of the human experience.</p>

<p>From an early age, I was drawn to the macabre, mysterious, and technological,</br> finding beauty in the unconventional.
   My time at UW-Madison was spent exploring various mediums,<br/> ultimately leading to a deep fascination with how dark themes can
   evoke powerful emotions and provoke thought.</p>

<p>In my creative process, I work to seamlessly integrate artificial intelligence, using it as a source of inspiration<br/> and a tool for
  experimentation. This marriage of technology and artistry allows me to push boundaries<br/> and create pieces that challenge the
   viewer's perceptions, inviting them to confront their own darkness.</p>
